# Security

`otk` assumes that any omnifest it processes comes from a trusted source. You should **NOT** run `otk` on an untrusted omnifest. The outputs produced by `otk` inherit the same trust level meaning that a malicious omnifest will produce a malicious output that should **NOT** be propagated to other programs.
