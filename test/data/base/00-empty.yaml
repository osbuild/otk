# This example shows the minimal `otk` omnifest to be considered valid. `otk.version` is a required property and is
# used to recognize a document as being an omnifest. Aside from that at least one `otk.target` is required. The target
# is used by `otk` to determine how to format any output.
#
# The results of compiling this omnifest are available in `00-empty.json`.
